# monopoly game
a monopoly game using python (and pygame)

to play it (on windows), go to monopoly\install folder, there you will find a setup.bat (monopoly\install\setup.bat) file (and a python installer). After running setup.bat, run the main.py (monopoly\main.py) file. I can only test the game on windows so if you use macos or linux, then you need to install python and pygame manually and hope, that my code works there

it's not ready yet, I have only a couple of the 40 tiles made and there is not much game logic right now
