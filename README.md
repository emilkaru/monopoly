# monopoly game
a monopoly game using python (and pygame)

to play it, go to monopoly\install folder, there you will find a setup.bat (monopoly\install\setup.bat) file (and a python installer) 

it's not ready yet, I have only a couple of the 40 tiles made and there is not much game logic right now
