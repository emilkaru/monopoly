# monopoly game
a monopoly game using python (and pygame)

The game has very little logic yet and only displays the tiles. I will be updating it and (maybe) make it functional some day. The tiles (and the text on them) was taken from an Estonian version of monopoly, I plan to change it to English and make better icons for the tiles when the game is ready.


Setup and running the project
=============================
The only requirement is python & the pygame package.
This was developed using python 3.10.4 & pygame version 2.1.2, but should work on any modern version.

To install pygame with pip: `pip install pygame`

To start the game: `python main.py`
